                        Solar power is among the cheapest sources of clean energy. Suppose you want to use the 800sqft rooftop of your home to set up solar panels. Over its lifetime, it will cut down 209 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions — the same as saving 335 teak trees. That’s huge.
But it’ll cost a lot, at least initially — without subsidy, setting it up will cost over Rs 3 lakh. With subsidy, it’ll be around Rs 2.2 lakh.

                        Reservation for the economically weaker section (EWS) brought about by the 103rd Constitution amendment in 2019 has managed to overcome what was termed as an “insurmountable obstacle” by legal experts.
                        Their opinion was based on the interpretation of the Supreme Court’s landmark Indra Sawhney judgment (1992), by which it had allowed reservations for backward classes, but specifically rejected quotas based solely on the criteria of economic status, and had, largely speaking, capped the reservations at 50%. The judgment had said that exceeding the cap had to be based on “extraordinary situations”.
